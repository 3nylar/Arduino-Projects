# Arduino Mini Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a collection of hands-on Arduino mini projects focused on practical learning in electronics and embedded systems. The projects demonstrate how hardware components interact with software to solve simple real-world problems using the Arduino platform.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time system behavior through practical implementation.
